# create_anaglyph
GIMP Plugin to create Anaglyphs.
## Caution
The anaglyphs (stereo images) generated with this plugin may cause eyestrain or headache. Do not look too long at these images, especially if you compose images with conflicting depth cues: e.g. stereoscopic depths information conflicting with (unlogical) occlusion information. 
## Documentation
The plugin and the plugin code, both, are described as doxygen documentation included in the source files.
